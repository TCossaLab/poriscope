MainController Overview
=======================

The MainController is the central orchestrator that connects models and views.

It listens for events triggered by views (e.g., user actions), delegates tasks to the appropriate models, and updates the interface accordingly.

Beyond coordination, the MainController also handles plugin discovery, instantiation, and communication. Think of it as the “brain” of Poriscope — ensuring smooth interaction between user-facing components and backend logic.
