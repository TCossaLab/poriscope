Where to Begin
==============

Before building your first plugin in Poriscope, ask yourself:

**What kind of plugin do I want to create?**

Plugin Types
------------

**Analysis Tab Plugin**  
Includes both a graphical interface (frontend) and logic (backend).  
Follows a full MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure.

**Data Plugin**  
Logic-only plugins — no UI.  
Simpler structure (often just a single class) depending on your needs.


Once you pick the type of plugin you want to build, the process changes quite a bit depending on your choice.

If you're going with an analysis tab, there's a bit more setup involved — but don’t worry, we’ve made it as smooth as possible thanks to our base classes.

You focus on your logic and interface; we’ll handle the wiring behind the scenes.
