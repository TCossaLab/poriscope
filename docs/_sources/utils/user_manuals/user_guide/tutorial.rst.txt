Tutorial and Documentation
==========================

A **built-in tutorial** is available for each tab or for the full workflow. To initiate it, go to the **Help → Tutorial** menu.

When launched, the tutorial will display an onboarding popup tailored to your current analysis tab, or it will start from the beginning if you're on the landing page. Each popup includes short instructions and highlights specific UI elements for interaction.

While progressing through the tutorial:

- It is **strongly recommended** to **perform the described action** before clicking “Next”. While not mandatory, it’s considered good practice for learning by doing.
- At the end of each tab’s tutorial, you’ll be prompted to either continue to the next step or click “Done” to finish early.

The tutorial gives a **high-level overview** of actions in each tab. To fully understand parameters, implications, and edge cases, you should **refer to this documentation alongside the tutorial**.

Once a new plugin (e.g., RawDataController, EventAnalysisController) has been opened, it will **automatically be added to the sidebar**.

This allows **quick access** to previously opened analysis tabs without needing to use the top **Analysis → New Analysis Tab** menu again.
