=========

**class HackyList()**

Bases: :class:`~poriscope.plugins.list`

HackyList is a subclass of Python's built-in list that allows arbitrary
attribute assignment. It exists to support use cases where a list-like
structure is required but needs to carry additional metadata or
auxiliary attributes, which native Python lists do not allow.

This class is used to return a list like object for sublevel edges from
_locate_sublevel_transitions to return edges and attatch extra information
along with it i.e. sublevel heights.

Example usage:
    >>> hl = HackyList([1, 2, 3])
    >>> hl.heights = [1.2, 4.1, 0.1]
    >>> hl.extra = {}
    >>> print(hl, hl.heights, hl.extra)
    [1, 2, 3] [1.2, 4.1, 0.1] {}
