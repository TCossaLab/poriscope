    :ref:`MetaEventFinder` is the base class for finding events within your nanopore data and represents the first analysis and transformation step. :ref:`MetaEventFinder` depends on and is linked at instantiation to a :ref:`MetaReader` subclass instance that serves as its source of nanopore data, meaning that creating and using one of these plugins requires that you first instantiate a reader. :ref:`MetaEventFinder` can in turn be the child object of :ref:`MetaWriter` subclass isntance for downstream saving of the data found by a instance of a subclass of :ref:`MetaEventFinder`.

    What you get by inheriting from MetaEventFinder
    -----------------------------------------------

    :ref:`MetaEventFinder` provides a common and intuitive API through which to identify segments of a nanopore timeseries that represent events (whatever that means for you) and flag them for writing to disk, excluding the uninteresting parts. In practice, this means that the size of nanopore data can be reduced by up to 1000x by keeping only the segments that matter. This operation is a precursor to downstream analysis, which operates only on the data segments flagged by subclasses of this base class.

        Value and Type are required. All values provided must be consistent with Type.

        Your Eventfinder MUST include at least the "MetaReader" key, which can be ensured by calling ``settings = super().get_empty_settings(globally_available_plugins, standalone)`` before adding any additional settings keys

        This function must implement returning of a dictionary of settings required to initialize the filter, in the specified format. Values in this dictionary can be accessed downstream through the ``self.settings`` class variable. This structure is a nested dictionary that supplies both values and a variety of information about those values, used by poriscope to perform sanity and consistency checking at instantiation.

        While this function is technically not abstract in :ref:`MetaEventFinder`, which already has an implementation of this function that ensures that settings will have the required :ref:`MetaReader` key available to users, in most cases you will need to override it to add any other settings required by your subclass. If you need additional settings, which you almost ccertainly do, you **MUST** call ``super().get_empty_settings(globally_available_plugins, standalone)`` **before** any additional code that you add. For example, your implementation could look like this:
